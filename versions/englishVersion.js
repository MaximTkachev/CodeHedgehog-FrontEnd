To do this, the jury writes a special interactor program, the output of which is sent to your solution, and the output of your solution is sent to the interactor. In other words, your solution and the interactor work in pairs and both your solution and the interactor can make a decision about what to output at the moment based on \"communication history\".\n" +

For example, when programming in C++, you need to use fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() (depending on whether you output using scanf/printf or cout). In Java, you need to use the flush method for the output stream, for example, System.out.flush(). In Python, you can use stdout.flush(). In Pascal, you can use flush(output).
